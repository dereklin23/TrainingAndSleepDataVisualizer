# Goal Tracking Feature

## Overview
Athlete Signal now includes a comprehensive goal tracking system that helps athletes set, monitor, and achieve their training and recovery targets. The system tracks both weekly and monthly goals with visual progress indicators and streak tracking.

## Features

### 1. **Goal Setting**
Users can set goals for:
- **Mileage**: Weekly or monthly running distance targets (miles)
- **Runs**: Number of runs per week or month
- **Average Sleep**: Target average sleep duration (hours)
- **Average Readiness**: Target average Oura readiness score

Each goal can be individually enabled or disabled, giving users full flexibility.

### 2. **Visual Progress Tracking**
- **Progress Bars**: Animated progress bars show completion percentage
- **Gradient Cards**: Beautiful gradient backgrounds differentiate weekly vs monthly goals
- **Completion Indicators**: Goals automatically change to green gradient when completed
- **Current vs Target**: Clear display of current progress and remaining amount

### 3. **Streak Tracking**
The system automatically tracks:
- **Sleep Streak**: Consecutive days with 8+ hours of sleep
- **Run Streak**: Consecutive days with at least one run
- **Readiness Streak**: Consecutive days with readiness score ≥ 85
- **Personal Bests**: Tracks and displays all-time best streaks

### 4. **Smart Calculations**
Goals update automatically based on:
- **Weekly Goals**: Last 7 days of data
- **Monthly Goals**: Current calendar month data
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress recalculates whenever date range changes

### 5. **Data Persistence**
- Goals are saved to browser localStorage
- Survives page refreshes and browser sessions
- Per-device customization (users can have different goals on different devices)

## User Interface
